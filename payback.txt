payback
bet you hate that

you thought that i'd forget the past
i'm bout to take your ass to class
you ignite my flame like gas
and imma burn you down to ash
shattering your teeth like glass
i put my foot up in your ass
then carve my name into your back
so you remember who i am

you know who the fuck you are you stupid bitch. when i see you it's on sight. years have passed but i haven't forgotten shit. and i won't until you're swallowing my fist.
