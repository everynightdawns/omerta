<pre><span>garbage
throw me out

you hate me, bitch?
i hate me, too
tell me, what the fuck am i supposed to do?
unload a fucking clip and see my brain cells ooze?
i bet you’d love to know i ain’t got shit to lose

i’ve looked up to the sky so many times and asked it why
“why does mother cry? is it cause i get high?
i’m sorry, father, i can’t help it i just want to die
should i fucking lie? or am i justified?”
he told me “kid, go fuck yourself. you’re my biggest mistake
why are you this way? i can’t fucking say.”
so i took his advice and shot my children on his face
you cannot destroy what you did not create

there’s garbage in my veins
and it spills into the garbage in my brain
when it kills me, throw me out
let me fill the lonely ground
garbage ‘til it swallows me down

always on the edge
hung over the ledge
should i dive into the ground and paint the pavement red?
all the things you said
running through my head

the lord of flies exposed the lies my father tried to hide
so i opened my eyes
and she opened her thighs
she told me she would give me love if i gave her my life
i told her that’s fine
and she told me you’re mine

garbage
throw me out

there’s garbage in my veins
and it spills into the garbage in my brain
when it kills me, throw me out
let me fill the lonely ground
garbage ‘til it swallows me down
